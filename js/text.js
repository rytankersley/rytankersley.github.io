        condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must be well 
        thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into 
        disgrace, into a snare of the devil.  /  This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what 
        remained into order, and appoint elders in every town 
        as I directed you— if anyone is above reproach, the 
        husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not 
        open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. For an 
        overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must 
        not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or 
        greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of good, 
        self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. He must hold 
        firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be 
        able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke 
        those who contradict it. For there are many who are

        One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, 
        “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 
        This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, 
        that they may be sound in the faith, not devoting themselves 
        to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away 
        from the truth. 15 To the pure, all things are pure, but 
        to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but 
        both their minds and their consciences are defiled. 
        They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works.

        `"It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife. And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.

        For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. 
        When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
        you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
        
        Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? 
        Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
        Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
        
        I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— 
        not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to 
        go out of the world. 11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is 
        guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. 
        For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church[b] whom you are to judge?"

        For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside. 
        “Purge the evil person from among you.”  /  As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. 
        One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. 
        Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. 
        Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the 
        Lord is able to make him stand.

        One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. 
        The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, 
        while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. 
        For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. 
        For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. 
        For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
        
        1Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; 
        for it is written,
        
        “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,
            and every tongue shall confess[b] to God.”
        
        So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.

            `But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. 
            For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, 
            for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. 
            When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. 
            For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. 
            What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I 
            say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.

            For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, 
            and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 
            In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, 
            in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
            
            Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. 
            Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 
            For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. 
            That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died."
